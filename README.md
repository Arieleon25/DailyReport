# DailyReport
The Daily Report (DR) is a program designed for students of The Tech Academy to submit their daily progress and feedback. It prompts students with a series of questions and collects their responses, which are then saved for review by the instructors.

# Project Description
The purpose of the Daily Report is to gather important information from students regarding their progress, challenges, and feedback. The program ensures that students provide relevant details and allows the instructors to respond accordingly.

# Instructions
Upon running the program, the user will be greeted with the message "The Tech Academy" followed by "Student Daily Report."

The program will proceed to ask a series of questions, which should be answered appropriately and with the correct data type:

"What is your name?" (String)

"What course are you on?" (String)

"What page number?" (Integer)

"Do you need help with anything? Please answer 'true' or 'false'." (Boolean)

"Is there any other feedback you'd like to provide? Please be specific." (String)

"How many hours did you study today?" (Float)

After all the questions have been answered, the program will display the message "Thank you for your answers. An Instructor will respond to this shortly. Have a great day!" This marks the end of the program.
